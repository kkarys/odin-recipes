        <h2>Description</h2>
        Look no further for a method to make hard-cooked eggs. Fresh or old, they are easy to peel. This works for 1 to 12 eggs.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 eggs, at room temperature</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a steamer insert into a pot and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to just below a boil. Add eggs to steamer insert and steam for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Immediately transfer eggs to a bowl of ice water until cool enough to handle. Make a small crack on the large end of each egg and place eggs back into the ice water for about 20 minutes. Peel.</li>
